# The card project.

Its not super exciting, but it is what it is. 

The plan is to copy the code from the Code Institute source code, paste it in. 
All the while gitting every step of the way. Then I will change a few things, git that. 
Then create a Bootstrapped branch and learn how that whole branching thing works. Ok. Cool. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Trying to learn Bootstrap with another stylesheet already in place isn't working.

I learned better ways to think when adapting existing code to new content. 
I adapted somewhat to the python port command situation, still wondering why it isn't part of the GPod framework.

### Most importantly I learned that if you don't push your committed repo, you lose it. So there.
