# The card project.

Its not super exciting, but it is what it is. 

The plan is to copy the code from the Code Institute source code, paste it in. 
All the while gitting every step of the way. Then I will change a few things, git that. 
Then create a Bootstrapped branch and learn how that whole branching thing works. Ok. Cool.
